# About Me

I am a incoming PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, where I will be working under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Yichen Chen](https://peterchencyc.com/) and [Prof. Chao Liu](https://chaoliu.tech/). Prior to joining UBC, I was a research assistant at the University of Hong Kong. I earned both my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from Southeast University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Lifeng Zhu](https://ins.seu.edu.cn/zlf/list.htm).

My research interests lie in the areas of Physics Simulation, Graphics, and Robotics. Specifically, my research aims to address two key questions:  

- How can rigorous physics simulation be effectively integrated with data-driven methods to optimize their respective strengths?
- What role can physics simulation play in facilitating interactions between robots and their environment, thereby enhancing decision-making capabilities.
