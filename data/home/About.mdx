# About Me

I am a incoming PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, where I will be working under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Yichen Chen](https://peterchencyc.com/) and [Prof. Chao Liu](https://chaoliu.tech/). Prior to joining UBC, I was a research assistant at the University of Hong Kong. I earned both my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from Southeast University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Lifeng Zhu](https://ins.seu.edu.cn/zlf/list.htm).

My research focuses on Physics Simulation, Graphics, and Robotics, blending theory with practical innovation. My work targets:

- Merging Physics and Data-Driven Methods: I combine rigorous physics simulations with data-driven techniques to optimize their strengths for efficient, accurate solutions in graphics and robotics.

- Boosting Robot Decision-Making: I use physics simulation to enhance how robots interact with their environment, enhancing their ability to interpret physical cues, adapt to real-time changes, and make precise decisions.
