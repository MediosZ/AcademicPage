    description: `We provide the surgeons an aiding tool, sparing the orthognathic experts from the laborious annotation of facial landmarks. Instead of being final outcomes that cannot be adjusted further, landmarks indicated by our proposed tool serve as initial reference results that can be changed by surgeons in a user-friendly way. To get a face prediction for the postoperative appearance, the refined landmarks and original meshes are both passed through a prediction network based on a parametric model and point set network.`,

    title: 'AR Facial Tracking',
    description: `We proposed a pipeline that can recognize the face orientation of patients and attach the expected appearance on the video frame to give them the illusion that they are staring into a miraculous mirror with a beautified facial contour on the medical basis. As a result, individuals are better able to decide whether to have orthognathic surgery as they possess the ability to anticipate the future.`,
